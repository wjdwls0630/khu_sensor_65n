####### Define scenarios
## This is example, modify this according to your scenarios.
##
## Generally, FLOORPLAN_SCN, PLACE_OPT_SNC and ROUTE_SCN uses worst function mode scenario such as func1_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN uses all cts scenario such as funccts_wstti,scantcts_wstti,bistcts_wstti,jtagcts_wstti.
## CLOCK_OPT_PSYN_SCN, ROUTE_OPT_SCN and CHIP_FINISH_SCN uses all scenarios except for CLOCK_OPT_CTS_SCN.
## HOLD_ONLY_SCN optimizes only hold time and mttv.
## So, you uses best corner scenarios such as func1_bst,scan1_bst,bist1_bst and jtag_bst.

# Thus, most foundry companies chose to have "tap-less" libraries like samsung 65nm.
# However, as we all know, if the device does not have taps, the Latch-up can easily occur.

# In aggressive scaling down technology, the gate oxide is so thin and sensitive that
# the transistor, which connect to power or ground rails directly, can be easily damaged
# due to voltage fluctuation in the power supply, such as ESD.
# ESD: the abbreviation of Electro Static Discharge. The ESD is sudden flow of static
# electricity between two electrical charge for a very short duration.
# EOS(Electric Over-Stress) is also one byprouct of ESD.
# ESD generates high peak voltage and current that may damage the IC.
# ESD usually occurs when two objects that have different potential contact directly.
# In terms of VLSI, it is usually occurs the I/O pads which are exposed to external world directly.
# Hence, I/O pads have ESD protection circuits consisted of diodes.
# By the way, to protect ESD, the Tie cells are needed. The Tie cells are didode connected NMOS or PMOS.
# Hence tie cells, which are diode connected nmos or pmos are used instead.
# Also, the outputs of these cells are driven through diffusion to provide isolation
# from the power and ground rails(not directly connect to the rails) for better ESD protection. The standard cell abstract
# methodology assumes that these cells are used to tie off any inputs to power and ground.
# If these cells are not used and the router is allowed to drop vias on the power rail,
# DRC errors or shorts may result.
# The TIEHI cell drives the output to a logic constant high. (usually used when input logic is 1)
# On the contrary, The TIELO cell drives the output to a logic constant low. (usually used when input logic is 0)
# Lastly, due to a configuration of the tie cells in samsung 65nm,
# the tie cells have lower leakage current compared to diodes, and rewiring the ECO cells is easy.

# Note Checklist prior to CTS
# 1. Placement must be finished clearly.
# 2. Verify P/G nets are prerouted properly.
# 3. Verify Congestion value. Congestion value must be lower than 4.
# 4. After placement, the ideal situaltion is that there is no timing violation.
# If it has, it may be okay, but not recommend.
# 5. Check your high fan out nets (hfn)
